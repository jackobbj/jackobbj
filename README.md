Each folder splits into an excercise category followed by the language i chose to do that excercise in. For example:

<center><code>LeetCodeProblems/JavaLeet/Twosum.Java</code></center>

Is a problem from leetcode written in java. (The problem is called TwoSum.) All solutions to puzzles found online were designed and implemented by me before I veiwed the solution and were not modified after the fact. In addition to this any inspiartion taken from any other sources will be referenced with a link in the comments of the source code.
